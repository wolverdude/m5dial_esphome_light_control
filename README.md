## M5Dial Light Control

ESPHome code that makes an M5Dial into a control for smart lighting through Home Assistant.

This is currently a non-working prototype. See [the demo](https://youtu.be/EylmO_z1Vq0).

The code is based on work by dgaust and others [in this thread](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/m5stack-dial-esp32-s3-smart-rotary-knob/623518). The original YAML by dgaust was copied from [here](https://github.com/dgaust/esphome_files/blob/547090c/m5dial.yaml).
